# Collective Access to IIIF

This repository contains scripts to create [IIIF Presentation Manifests](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/) for records and collections in [Collective Access](https://www.collectiveaccess.org/).

## Development

Install [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) javascript runtime (>= 1.2.2).

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.2. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
